Once again, Alex pressed the button on the remove, and screams fill the room, overwhelming em within seconds. No matter how many times ey tries to lower the volumes, the two boxed angry heads on the screen yell at each other with full force. Neither obviously bothers listening to the other’s points or even attempts in having a levelled conversation. Alex feels like the moderator stuck in the middle: confused, exhausted, tense.

//They should pay people to watch this…//

It is hard for em to figure out the topic of the ongoing conversation — if you could call this shouting match that. It seems to matter very little for the two veiny faces, as they keep <<link "changing subjects">><<popup "Info: Shout">><</link>> with a drop of a hat. Even the text ribbon at the bottom of the screen that is supposed to keep track of the topic struggles. Alex’s head spins.

Even after changing the channel, Alex’s hand still shakes around the remote, and eir ears still ring with echoes of angry tones. It takes em a while for eir breath to return to a calmer pace and get eir bearings. There’s a <<link "reason">><<popup "Info: Reason">><</link>> why ey will usually avoid this show.

It is the delightful sounds of chirping birds and the calm voice of a seasoned narrator bringing Alex back to reality, grounding their attention to what is actually on the screen. Broadcast on this channel is an old-ish documentary, from a <<link "few years ago">><<popup "Info: Docu">><</link>>, one that is surely putting hundreds of viewers to sleep with the monotone tone and the low-energy images. 

//An insomniac’s delight//, eir roomate would say. Ey, however, doesn’t find it numbing enough to fall asleep or interesting enough to pay attention to what is happening. //The birds are pretty. I guess…//

As Alex presses another button on the remote, the birds take flight and leave the screen, making space for the next channel and their riveting show — that’s what ey hopes, at least…

Gone are the calming sounds of trickling water, gone are the tame and relaxing long takes of Nature’s landscapes; it’s all about janky cuts of home décor transformation, crazy camera close-ups on hunky men working with big manly tools, and outdated high-tempo pop songs. In a middle-of-nowhere home, a team of ‘experts’ redesign a space to fit the lucky family’s wishes, before spending a whooping whole week to tear down the house and ‘build’ it all back up. 

Watching this type of shows always brought em mixed feelings. On the one hand, ey is extremely jealous of the families receiving this ‘make-over’, as they already own a home and get to see this army of crazy hot hunks for a full whole week. On the other hand, the whole transformation is so bad it’s just laughable, and ey <<link "pities">><<popup "Info: Remodel">><</link>> the families for it. On the other //other// hand, those men on the screen make the whole repair/décor process so sexy and easy, Alex doesn’t know whether to remodel eir apartment or just lust on the flexing muscles on the screen. On the other //other other// hand, ey remembers ey is completely alone…

Alex bitterly leaves the hunky men with those big manly tools and flexing muscles behind, as ey changes the channel once more. Only slightly bitter, since the reno was starting to make em depressed: ey isn’t on track with the whole ‘life-goals-that-ey-should-have-passed-already’. So ey’d rather distract emself than spiralling about the ‘coulda-woulda-shoulda’ .And what a better way to do so with a film!

//Oh… oh, no… //

Alex cringes when ey recognises the images on the screen. In this scene, two young women are running through some dark halls, faces filling with tears and fear. An shadowy entity follows them, close enough to add this sense of danger, but far enough to give the protagonists hope they could escape it. If they keep managing to avoid those misty tentacles trying to grab them, missing them only by a hair. One of the woman stumbles, when her foot meets a carpet plead, and falls. She turns to the entity, white as a sheet, screaming her lungs out. Two bright fangs appear from the shadow…

This used to be Alex’s favourite horror film, one ey would watch every so often because of the campiness of the piece and the strangely comforting feeling it left em when the credits rolled. It was eir father who introduced em to the genre, and brought em to the theatre release. //Now…// Alex only felt <<link "bitterness">><<popup "Info: Movie">><</link>> looking at those faces.

Eir heavy heart feels lighter when Alex changes the channel one more time. Almost at peace, even.

But this does not last either, as ey is soon bombarded with more bright colours, flashy graphics, overly excited hosts, and screeching guest, just for…

//…some random crap they want to sell to their insomniac and lonely audience. Touted as the cream of la crème for the low low price of your arm or your leg, you too can have the best *** experience!//

Between the awkward replays ‘showing off’ the merchandise and the obvious forced lines about their features, the too-perfect smiles and the démodé outfits, a parade of cheap products are pushed onto the viewers as what they need to buy //right now//! 

Watching this, Alex feels a bit stick in eir stomach. Ey is not particularly green emself, but this whole waste of resources to make all this useless crap that people really don’t need, which will definitely be tossed into landfills one way or another, doesn’t sit right with em. Neither are the tactics used to pressure viewers to //buy now or they’ll miss the deal of the century//. The distraction populating the screen so the viewers can’t even think straight, <<link "particularly">><<popup "Info: Product">><</link>>.

//Ugh… no more for today…//

Eir horrified screams buzz in eir ears, shaking eir whole body. Those piercing eyes and menacing canines are still burnt on eir retina. Tears roll down eir cheeks, and ey finds emself sobbing. 

“What… what was…”

Alex struggles to take deep breaths to calm emself down, broken by the sobs and sniffles, still shaking from the ordeal. When ey does finally regain some of eir composure, ey wipes eir eyes and…

“I… I am… home?”

Ey is back on the couch, in eir apartment, as if ey never left. Alex scans the room, in disbelief. Just a moment ago — barely seconds — ey were still on the set of //Teatime with a Vampire//, standing before its host. Now, ey is back home, safe under the covers. But with eir body damp from cold sweat, ey shivers.

“I… How did I get…”

Disoriented, Alex looks around the room for familiar anchors. Though everything seems to be in its place, looking as it should, ey cannot shake the feeling that something is amiss here. Eir lips quivering and eyes on the verge of crying once more, Alex wraps eir arm around eir body and hugs emself tightly.

It takes a while for Alex to notice eir hand scratching the side of eir neck. //Why is it itching so much?//

When Alex presses a button on the remote, the screen freezes for the longest of second on the gorgeous face of the vampire — it almost burns on the surface. Did he just… wink? at me? Before ey could continue that train of thought, the TV moves on to a return of some <<link "dull old sitcom">><<popup "Info: Sitcom">><</link>>. 

Were it any other day, ey wouldn’t bother with the show either. It is not really eir cup of tea, especially the dry humour and the inappropriate jokes. But, in the corner of the room, ey sees a <<cycle "_poop" once>><<optionsfrom _cycle>><</cycle>> //Was that always in there?//

Commercials break the immersion, and Alex forgets about it.

//Can’t be bothered…//

Alex pushes the remote to the side and lets eir head fall back on the couch, eyes staring at the colours flickering on the ceiling. Because of the colourful set of the show and the contrasted individuals on TV, shades of yellows and reds, and sometimes greens, dance with the shadowy blues. Pushing and pulling, twirling, merging and separating. Ey lets out a deep sigh.

//What am I doing with my life?//

Alone, in eir shared apartment. Left behind, on a Friday night, while the rest of the world hunts for welcoming arms. Lonely, on a loveseat sofa, whose only recent seen action was em getting up to grab some junk food and coming back with crumbs. With eir only company being the strangers on the other side of screen, unaware always of eir presence.

And it really has been so fucking hard lately. To think about things. To care about thing. To do… anything. Eir drawer used to be full of spoons, but too many found their way into the trash, disappearing forever. Eir life reduced to struggles and pain, unwelcoming the rising sun of the morrow. It was painful to go to work and have those mindless talk with eir co-workers or get yelled at by eir micro-managing boss. It was draining to remember to eat all eir meals and take all eir vitamins just to keep standing, to brush eir teeth at least twice a day, to have a shower once in a while. To live. To survive. To cope.

Even getting out of bed is getting hard now…

It’s like a prison to em, where the walls keep getting closer and closer, suffocating em. A tunnel that keeps going and going, and the light at the end of it forever moving further and further away. Even with eir roommate and the few friends ey has left trying to help em in their own ways, Alex could not find solace or any peace. Ey is stuck in place, unable to change.

Ey knows ey needs all the help ey can get, but ey doesn’t know what ey needs exactly, or even where to start. Lodged in this cycle of beating emself up for doing nothing, thinking of ways to change things, and freezing when having to choose what to do first. So ey wails in silent despair, wrapped in layers of long-unwashed covers on the couch, letting time pass em by,

In the bright darkness, looking at the never ending dance of colours, eir lids feel heavy.

\
<<crowd>>Crowd gasps<</crowd>>\
\
<<alex>>I… What?<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>You admitted being quite obsessed with the //Midnight Boys// when you were younger, especially their leader. An obsession that led you to cover your bedroom with paraphilia of the young men. One that led you to write fictional pieces about us. Did this obsession awaken something in you? Like a particular attraction toward us midnight walkers?<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>I—
''{''//squints//''}''
I don’t think I follow.<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>It was also pretty common for fans of the group to adorn fake bites on their body, but you went further than this, //didn’t you//? You went to seek out the canines of actual vampires. You wanted them. You longed for them. So much so, you would date quite a handful of us, in quick succession just to get that fix.<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>Hey, now! That’s not—<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>This is what you were thinking about when you saw me on the screen, isn’t it? The way you looked at my face, at my smile, at my fangs. You hoped I would plunge them into your neck or your wrists, didn’t you? Maybe even your thighs?<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>What are you—<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>It’s true our bites can become quite addictive, especially when moderation is not followed. And you still seek this rush. The pressure against the skin. The sharp pain at first, and the intense pleasure that follows. You—<</orlok>>\

<<alex>>Where to start…<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>Maybe the worst to best again? To rip the bandage off.<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>Right… //Rhys//.
''{''//winces//''}'' 
He found me at my lowest of lows. And pushed me even further down. The things he did to me were —
''{''//looks at the camera, then away//''}''
— not appropriate to say on TV. I… I was in a lot of pain for a long time.
''{''//forced chuckle//''}''
I don’t think I’m over everything that happened with him.<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>''{''//grabs hand//''}''
I’m sorry, Alex. I—<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>''{''//faint smile//''}''
It’s ok… Well, no, it’s not ok. But I’m… better.
''{''//takes deep breath//''}''
Anyway… Before Rhys, there was Carmilla. <<if $ex>>I already talked about her. I don’t think we need to go over that again.<<else>>She… she was something. We didn’t part on good terms — I don’t think we’ll ever be on good terms again. Communication was a problem between us. And her not accepting me as I was — am.<</if>><</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>''{''//presses Guest hand//''}''<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>Samara…
''{''//sighs//''}''
Samara was a wonderful gal, and I’ll cherish the moments we shared forever. She’s a wonderful friend… //when she’s here//. But she often goes AWOL and no one hears from her or can get in touch with her then. It was very frustrating and hurtful when we were together. I was worried I’d never see her again often. She’d just get up one morning, leave for work and just… come back weeks later as if nothing happened.
''{''//melancholic smile//''}''
//Dorian…// Dorian was so full of himself.
''{''//chuckles//''}''
To be fair, he was very handsome. I don’t think I’ve met anyone as beautiful as Dorian. And a great lay! 
''{''//fans emself//''}''
One of the best. Maybe the best I’ve ever been with. But the relationship was just… superficial. There wasn’t really a spark or a connection between us. I don’t think he felt anything for anyone but himself.<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>That’s—<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>Ok! It’s ok.
''{''//chuckes//''}''
I don’t think he was looking for anything serious anyway. Not as serious as I wanted it to be. I don’t think he even cared when I broke things off. I’m pretty sure he shrugged and asked if we were still going to see a film or something.<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>And did you?<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>//Yeah…// He was paying.<</alex>>\
\
<<crowd>>Crowd laughs<</crowd>>\

\
<<orlok>>''{''//nods in approval//''}''<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>''{''//smiles//''}''
For Ely and Petyr… They… I couldn’t have asked for better partners at the time. They taught me so much, helped me understand a lot about my identity, and filled that emptiness in my heart. Wonderful people doing lots of good work too.<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>What happened with them?<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>They wanted kids. I wasn’t ready.
''{''//pause//''}''
Still not ready.
''{''//smiles//''}''
They are amazing parents to adorable twins. I babysit them from times to times.<</alex>>\
\
<<crowd>>Crowd awes<</crowd>>\
\
<<alex>>And Malik. Ze really broke my heart. 
''{''//purses lips//''}''<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>Why is ze so high on the list, then?<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>Because ze made me whole after Rhys. And even though it still hurts, I am so grateful for all that ze’s done for me. I owe zir my life. I…
''{''//chokes//''}''
I don’t think I’d be here today, alive, if not for zir. //God…//
''{''//wipes eyes//''}''
Ze was so patient with me, dealing with all that… baggage. And ze helped me deal through all of my [BEEP]. I don’t think I’ve met someone as kind and considerate as Malik.<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>So, why did it end?<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>It… It was my fault.<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>But you said ze broke your heart.<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>That’s because I wasn’t attentive enough with zir. I had become too dependent on zir to do anything for myself, by myself. I relied to much on zir that ze did not have any space to be zirself. Ze had to leave. It was the right thing to do for zir and me… And it broke my heart when ze did. It was for the best.<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>Are you and Malik still in contact?<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>Err…
''{''//scratches back neck, looking away//''}''
Anyway, Vlad. Vlad was great. Also my first… everything.<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>//Oooh?//<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>We were in highschool. He was in the rival school across the road. We had to date in secret.<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>A Romeo and Juliet romance…
''{''//winks//''}''<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>Except none of us had to //die//!
''{''//laughs//''}''
He was so sweet. A real gentleman, as far as teenagers can be.
''{''//smiles sadly//''}''
Haven’t seen him since college though. I hope he’s ok…<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>Was moving to college the reason things ended?<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>Eerrr… No. We’d ended things before any serious college talk. It was…
''{''//bites tongue//''}''
Mom never approved of Vlad. She believed ‘//his kind//’ would ruin ‘us’ — she has a lot of prejudices towards night walkers, you see. And Vlad used to shrug at this, he said he was used to it. But things changed when he asked me out for prom. 
''{''//inhales//''}''<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>What happended?<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>Mom didn’t just forbade me going there, she grounded me for the rest of the year. And when Vlad tried to help me sneak out to go to the prom, she—
''{''//looks down//''}''
— she ran after him with a stake in her hand.<</alex>>\
\
<<crowd>>Crowd gasp<</crowd>>\
\
<<orlok>>That… that’s…<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>Yeah… I don’t blame him for refusing to talk to me after that. Or cross the street when we’d meet in town. I… I wish I’d stopped him from coming to my house that day. Or… Or told off my mom before that.
''{''//cups head in hands//''}''
But I was so afraid of her at that point. I…
''{''//chokes//''}''<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>Is… If Vlad was here with us today… 
''{''//points at camera//''}''
Would there be something you’d like to say to him?<</orlok>>\

<<alex>>More than anyone else.
Gosh… I can see her smile in my mind right now. It’s as bright as sunshine.

Those bright and shiny golden pupils looking absolutely <<link "dead inside">><<popup "Info: DeadInside">><</link>>.

The pulpy red lips smiling forcefully, held together with those fangs of his — ey thinks ey see his mouth <<link "twitching at times">><<popup "Info: StupidGuest">><</link>>.

Fanning emself when he pulls his tie, showing an inch of skin. Gasping as he unbuttons his blazer. Eir mind runs wild, constructing unlikely scenarios where the two end up meeting, somewhere, sometime, somehow…

    His blazer undone, and so would be the two first button of his //chemise//, revealing just a hint of his torso. His roguish smile smirking when ey fumbles eir words. His cool hand caressing eir warm cheek, while his other would slowly walk up eir leg, pressing softly when getting closer to the hip. His aureate eyes burning right through em, taking eir breath away.  His fingers brushing eir lips before they kissed. His ivories grazing the nape of eir neck, making em shiver all over. And when they finally pressed on—

    “I could do that for you, Alex. That is… if you wanted it. Is that what you want, Alex?”

    The words barely echo in eir ears before ey springs up, eir head almost gyrating as ey looks for the voice from eir head. Ey thinks ey catches a whisper here, or maybe a murmur here. But, ey soon remembers ey is completely alone in this apartment. Nothing aside from the TV, and maybe the ambient noise from outside, sounds alike the voice. Save maybe for Mr Orlok, with that bright smile of his, babbling on to his bore of a guest on the other side of the screen. 

    //Maybe I’m just—//

  “— imagining things?” And, after a short pause. “Do you think you, Alex, are imagining things?”

Eir horrified screams buzz in eir ears, shaking eir whole body. Those piercing eyes and menacing canines are still burnt on eir retina. Tears roll down eir cheeks, and ey finds emself sobbing. 

“What… what was…”

Alex struggles to take deep breaths to calm emself down, broken by the sobs and sniffles, still shaking from the ordeal. When ey does finally regain some of eir composure, ey wipes eir eyes and…

“I… I am… home?”

Ey is back on the couch, in eir apartment, as if ey never left. Alex scans the room, in disbelief. Just a moment ago — barely seconds — ey were still on the set of //Teatime with a Vampire//, standing before its host. Now, ey is back home, safe under the covers. But with eir body damp from cold sweat, ey shivers.

“I… How did I get…”

Disoriented, Alex looks around the room for familiar anchors. Though everything seems to be in its place, looking as it should, ey cannot shake the feeling that something is amiss here. Eir lips quivering and eyes on the verge of crying once more, Alex wraps eir arm around eir body and hugs emself tightly.

It takes a while for Alex to notice eir hand scratching the side of eir neck. //Why is it itching so much?//

Alex closes eir eyes and tightens the cover around them. Even with the many thoughts torturing eir despairing mind, <<linkappend "sleep finds em quickly.">>

And yet, eir dreams are not without turmoil.

A familiar face, with pointy teeth, plagues em at every turn. The thin figure, a blurry copy of the vampiric host ey caught earlier on TV, keeps following em. Because of his roguish smile, Alex is unsure whether ey should be afraid or… //aroused? //

This confused state does not disappear when the figure tries to talk to em. With his arm gesturing, his face contracting, and lips moving, Alex should be able to figure out whether he is a friend or foe. But the strong distortion on his voice renders any sound leaving his lips menacing.

Alex does not understand any word coming out of his mouth. And ey is afraid.

When Alex opens eir eyes again, ey feels a smile growing on eir face.  Ey takes a deep breath, thinking about the last time ey woke up with a smile. Ey realises ey hasn’t had a night like this one in a very long while, one where sleep is so deep ey wakes up completely rested. It is a strange sensation for em.

//But… It’s not just…//

With the ease of a proper and restful night, Alex finds another peculiar feeling mangled in eir mind. Ey struggles to put a word for it — happiness doesn’t quite cover it, ey doesn’t feel that bright. Alex knows there are still arduous challenges ahead of em, many issues ey still needs to face. 

//But…// 

Ey hasn’t felt this way in so long. As if ey knew deep down that things will get better, that ey will be able to work things out, that ey will move eir life right back on track. A newfound hope that all will be fine. A newfound belief in themself.

//Yeah… it will be alright.//

When Alex opens eir eyes again, eir body springs up, and ey finds emself seated on the couch, with eir blanket still covering eir body. The suddenness of movement makes the room spin. Ey tries to grab on for dear life, but eir limbs still sleep, Alex falls on the floor, dizzy.

//Ouch…//

“Alex!” a familiar voice cries out behind em. “Are you ok?”

Ey looks past eir shoulder. Matt stands in door frame leading to the kitchen, their stupid “naked” apron on. //When did they get back?//

“Alex?”
“I… I’m fine?”
“You don’t //sound// fine. Are you hurt anywhere? Did you hit your head?”
“No! No… I just slipped, that’s all. Don’t worry.”
“Alex…”
“I promise, Matt,” ey tries to smile. “I’m //fine//.”
“Here,” eir roommate offers their hand. “Let me help you up.”
“Thanks,” Alex takes it. “Actually… No. Never—”
“Tell me,” their voice sounds like growl.
“Matt, it’s not— I promise I’m not hurt.”
“Tell me, Alex.”
“It’s just a //silly// thing.”
“Tell. Me.”
“Fine, fine,” ey relents. “I just feel good? Like rested— no, more than rested. Refreshed!”
“That’s not //that// odd… You’re probably on a high, sleeping less than four hours last night.”
“And—and not just that,” ey continues, ignoring the jab. “I’m light all over. Like all the pain, and the pressure, and the stress disappeared. All the weight is //gone//, Matt!”
“//Really//?” their brow arches.
“Yes, //really//, Matt. It’s like someone took all my worries, and just threw them away!” Alex frowns. “Maybe not taken… more like sucked it out of my body?”
“Sucked?” Matt giggles. “L—like—like a vampire?”
“Stop it,” Alex pushes them, playfully. “I’m being serious, here!”
“Sorry, sorry, mate. It’s just… with you— I was picturing you and Andrej—” they hold their side, laughing.
“You’re the worst,” Alex turns eir back, walking away.
“Sorry… continue, please.”
“Mmhh…”
“Come on, Alex. Tell me. What’s next?”
“Well… err… nothing? I just… haven’t felt like this since…” ey bites eir lips.
“Thana?”
“Yeah…”

Matt slaps eir back.

“Come on, mate. I made some pancakes.”
“With—”
“Yes, Alex.”
“Alright.”

Matt goes back to the kitchen, leaving Alex to eir thoughts. Ey moves closer to the window and, when the rising sun’s rays caress eir face, ey closes eir eyes. A tear rolls down eir cheek. Ey smiles.

//Thank you…//

:: Ignore [ending] {"position":"850,100","size":"100,100"}
Disturbed. Confused. Afraid… Alex can’t pin-point what exactly ey is feeling, but ey knows that hand repulses em. This unnatural appearance in eir home, floating, glitching through the screen. The source of this abominable screeching sound piercing eir ear until they bleed. Alex recoils from the calm face behind the hand, still sensuously smiling.

“What’s the //matter//, Alex?” 

Ey struggles to swallow, eir jaw shaking. //Am… Am I seeing this right? Is his hand coming closer?// Alex takes a few steps back, away from the television set, trembling in fear.// I’m sure there was just a wrist and now… Is that an elbow?//

“I thought you wanted… //me//, Alex,” the voice growls

And ey did, truly, not that long ago. Ey was lusting over the night walker, the one on the other side of the screen painfully trying to get any interesting bit of information out of his guest. That was before the spectre talked directly to em, through the TV, while being miles away from Alex’s apartment. Before his hand materialised out of nowhere in eir living room!

“Grab my hand, Alex! You //wanted// this!”

Ey yells with all eir lungs to drown out the noise and his voice. Ey lunges towards the remote and presses all its buttons. Unfortunately, none seems to work, even the //Off// button. Still, Alex does not waver, as ey runs behind the device, staying far enough away from the hand to avoid contact, and pulls its plug. The room falls into darkness.

<<linkappend "//Finally…//">>

Solace is only short lived, as the television restarts itself, and the hand reappears.

“You won’t get rid of me this quickly, Alex!”

Screaming, ey runs to eir room, slams the door behind em, and lock emself inside. Thinking ey can still hear the sound of the vampire’s voice, Alex jumps into eir bed, wraps emself with all the covers ey has in the hopes the unwanted guest won’t ever be able to reach em, get bored, and leave em alone.

Alex doesn’t sleep a wink that night, the chilling face of the pale man haunting em in the corner of eir eyes…

//Obviously, I’m imagining things…//

<<if lastVisited("ShowHot") is 1>>Alex can’t quite recall the last time ey slept. //Was it only yesterday? or maybe the day before?// A week could even be likely at this point. Even if ey barely left the couch, or eir bed, sleep had not been something ey had been doing. //But staring at the ceiling…//

It wasn’t an unknown fact to em that lack of sleep could make people see things that were not there, hear sounds no one else could hear. This strange limbo situation where senses could not even be trusted. Though the voice surprised em, the situation… doesn’t really, now that ey has calmed a bit. That isn’t even the first time this had happened to em either. The last time, ey saw fishes floating above em, while ey were riding the subway — just translucent gold fishes living their best life.\
<<else>>Alex can’t quite recall the last time ey had been intimate with someone, anyone. Ey hasn’t been in a relationship in quite some while, and even dating has sort of disappeared from eir schedule in the past couples of months. Now what ey is thinking seriously about it, ey cannot even remember the last time ey’d been kissed, or hugged, or even received a pat on the back. //And it’s not like I could ask <<link "them">><<popup "Info: Matt">><</link>>…//

It wasn’t an unknown fact to em that lack of intimacy could make people start seeing things that were not there, hear sounds not one else but them could hear. When daydreaming about what is not, imagining a better present than there is, or making up scenarios of what could happen, the line between illusion and reality blurs pretty quickly. Especially when the object of desire is this hot.

//I really need to get laid…//\
<</if>>
Alex takes a deep breath and turns off the TV, before wrapping em in the covers and lying more comfortably on the couch. Ey closes eir eyes and focuses on eir breathing to <<linkappend "calm emself down.">> 

Yet, it is not quite enough for em to forget what happened, as eir dreams are filled with echoes of the strange voice. Even more strange, is the blurry rendition of the vampiric host appearing every time the words ring eir ears…

When ey was younger, Alex used to have a crush on that boy band, //Midnight Boys//, started out from the vampire craze. Specifically, ey had a crush on its leader, //Andrej//. Their hit, //Bite me bite you//, charted for a whole year and Alex knew every single word of the song, in every language it was released. Em loudly singing ‘//Mord moi//’ would enrage eir mother.

It did not take long before she gathered all the paraphilia ey collected and forced em to burn them all in the backyard. Alex had to watch the posters ey may have kissed turn into ashes, dolls melt into unrecognisable puddles, and eir precious signed CDs disintegrate. To this day, ey is not sure whether she did this because ey was into the boys or because they were vampires.

Just thinking about it make em cringe. Ey had written it when ey just started highschool, at the peak of the vampire craze. With so many books and films featuring vampires coming out, one specific creative outlet bloomed: the fan-fiction world. Millions of stories were published in that period, and Alex was one of the contributors. With a humble dozen chapters, eir A[****]xB[****] pairing even brought controversies, as it steered away from the accepted ships. Still, ey enjoyed some popularity with <<link "//‘Stop it, boys!

//“I… I know what you are.”
“Of course, you do.”

B[****] turned to face the pixy-haired petite woman, her golden eyes piercing through each of her barriers with a single glance. She knew she was playing with fire, that her life was surely on the line. But she had to know, she had to be sure!

“You… you’re not surprised? That I found out, I m-mean.”
“I saw it happen,” A[****] tapped her temples.
“Wait…”

B[****] bit her lips and tucked her hair behind her ears. She’d miscalculated. She’d been all wrong. The cool skin was not about being undead but probably bad blood pressure. And the avoidance to sun could not be because A[****] would burn if one ray touched her skin but just an intolerance… Idiot!

“So you’re not a vampire? With all the glitter and the—”
“Of course, I am, B[****]!”

A[****] crystal laugh echoed through the forest. Her wide smile showed off her pronounced canines, but B[****] could only focus on her cute dimples.

“See?” A[****] got closer, her mouth wide open.

B[****] swiftly turner her back to the quirky woman. Her breath was smelling strangely delicious, like one of those pastries her dad used to get her, and— No, B[****]! The Truth! You need to know the truth!

“But you can also see the future too?”
“Yes,” A[****] responded simply.“Sorta.”
“How?!? Why?!? What do you mean ‘sorta’?!?”

A[****] shrugged, indifferent to B[****] bewilderment, her fingers walking up her arm. She was still smiling, with that one smile that made B[****] lose all her senses.

“You’re special, B[****]. More than you think you know. There’s just something about you—”//


:: Info: Garlic [popup] {"position":"975,1975","size":"100,100"}
This is obviously purely delusory, as contact with garlic is not deadly to the night walkers. This superstitious practice started after a… misunderstanding. 

Some hundred years ago, a vampire was on a date with a beautiful woman with a penchant for the pungent herb. In the midnight hour, after a tasty meal, the vampire made a move on the woman, which she accepted with open arms. Upon moving closer, the vampire found themself so repulsed by the garlic-y breath that nausea took a hold of them. Instead of handling the affair with reason, they hissed back into the shadow and disappeared.

No matter the proofs, none has ever managed to erase the myth from humanity’s belief.


:: Info: Guest [popup] {"position":"475,1850","size":"100,100"}
Alex didn’t quite catch the actor’s name, even with Mr Orlok constantly repeating it with a forced smile, not the film’s name he was promoting. Ey wasn’t particularly trying to pay much attention to what was happening on the screen either. Little interested em right now. Or for the past days. Maybe even weeks.

//Will I ever bother watching the film, anyway?//


:: Info: Matt [popup] {"position":"1100,1975","size":"100,100"}
Eir room-mate isn’t the type of person who enjoys physical contact. They only gave Alex a hug once. When Malik broke up with em and ey was drunk-crying in the shower at three in the morning… on a weekday.


:: Info: Movie [popup] {"position":"1225,1850","size":"100,100"}
Released some decades prior, //Running from V// was not without controversies. From the terrible filming conditions that left one actor with permanent frostbites, withholding pay at every level, to borderline breaking employment law during post-production with those twenty-hours work-days, it was a scoop published years later that finally tanked the reputation of the project. 

Messages from a secret group chat between the lead actresses revealed some pretty vile exchanges, which included slurs and insults. Those were not thrown at each other, but used to make fun of their former co-stars and more generally at other minorities. Some exchanges even included pictures of their fans, which they would comment on salaciously.

Honey blond short hair, parted and twisted into finger waves, unwavering thanks to a surely ungodly amount of hairspray, frames a chalky pale face, with that distinctive purple shadow under golden eyes. Graceful to a point of shaming the most elegant beings on the planet, his captivating smile splits his crimson lips, revealing pearly fangs.

This was how eir grandparents lost their retirement: buying cheap crap on late-night shows, because they believed the hosts’ lies that it would make their descendents happy. Not only did they have to sell off their house not long before passing, Alex had to help out sort out all that junk.


:: Info: Reason [popup] {"position":"850,1850","size":"100,100"}
It doesn’t just give em overload eir senses with the intense lights and roaring noise. When ey listens to their ‘arguments’ for too long, ey starts to hate emself and who ey is. The ‘debates’ tend to favour rhetoric going against eir identity, eir personhood. Ey only comes out of it depressed.


:: Info: Remodel [popup] {"position":"1100,1850","size":"100,100"}
Ey often laughs at the before/after montage to highlight what was ‘fixed’, as the results are bland at best to questionable at worst, often sprinkled with that flipper quality repair dust. But the pained eyes behind the forced smiles on the family’s faces when they see their newly made-over home for the first time always damper the mood.


:: Info: Shout [popup] {"position":"725,1850","size":"100,100"}
This lack of moderation should surprise absolutely no one. The channel cares more about ratings and viewership than having calm and collected debates with backed-up facts.

Bringing hating eyes together.

Yes, a vampire. On live television. Quite the novel concept some decades ago, one few thought possible. //Could they even appear on tape? or pictures?// many had wondered.

Yes. It turned out.

Nowadays, it is just… normal. 

//‘They’re just like us!’// touted magazines all over the world for years, featuring the nightly walkers in every of their issues, tracing family lines and connecting individuals, reporting on the horrors and the wonders. And between the awe and the hatred for those mystical beings, it turned out this catchline was not completely wrong…  aside from the whole blood sucking thing, and living only in the dark, that is.

Things calmed down, eventually. When nightlife started to boom, with the newcomers openly filling the street during the midnight hours, and the cash registers of many establishments, life returned to what it once was. 

Third shifts became much easier to fill, though…


:: Intro {"position":"750,425","size":"100,100"}
Hours have passed since Alex’s roommate left. Ey has not moved an since since, still lounging on the couch, now half-asleep. In front of em, the TV fills the dark room with bright lights and deafening sounds.This would overwhelm anyone, but Alex is barely paying attention to what is happening on the screen. Ey hasn’t for a while, as eir mind drifts in and out of consciousness. Yet, with eir eyes transfixed on the ever changing images, one could be fooled in thinking ey is watching TV.

In eir sluggish state, ey doesn’t bother changing channels — out of boredom or laziness, at this point, who could say. Before zoning out, ey landed on one of those trashy <<link "daytime talk-show">><<popup "Info: Daytime Show">><</link>> a while ago, led by the dazzling and charismatic <<link "Mr Orlok">><<popup "Info: Orlok">><</link>>: //Teatime with a Vampire//, or so the logo on the corner of the screen reads. 

In a timeless, straight out of the late Victorian Era, three-piece suit with a breasted vest, the <<link "vampire">><<popup "Info: Vampire">><</link>> converses with some <<link "C-list actor about some film">><<popup "Info: Guest">><</link>>. Or tries to, actually, as the actor doesn’t seem interested (or able) to move further than platitudes. All to the dismay of the host, who keeps attempting to stir the conversation (and the pot).

Alex couldn’t care less about the guest — or the show, for that matter — but the host… there was something about Mr Orlok that piqued eir mind.

Ey knows ey could reach for the remote and change the channel for a more interesting one. Though, there isn’t much to watch during this time of day. Well… //night//.

//Of course not! That’d be…//

… preposterous. Ey is sound of mind, even if not really of body right now. But Alex doesn’t utter the words, any of them, choking before they even pass eir lips. Ey is pretty sure ey is not hallucinating, but a small part of em doubt it still. Ey knows ey is alone and yet… This doesn’t seem to matter, as the voice continues without eir input:

“Now that we’ve established I am quite real, would you care to look me in the eyes?”

Alex stays still for a moment longer, frozen between indecision and confusion.

“I find it more polite to be conversing with someone — well, anyone, really — with interlocked gaze. It is about respect, you understand? I quite rather dislike finding myself in those awkward situation, where I talk to no end but my conversation partner is focusing on anything but me! The gall of some people… In any way, I would like to avoid—”

When Alex regains some control over eir body, it’s as if the voice forgot about em, carrying on with their little rant. Strangely, the torrent of words in the background grounds them enough to actually do something. Ey scans the room once more, keeping an ear on the voice in hopes to find it. But eir eyes only finds darkness. Ey struggles to swallow.

“Where—”
“Right in front of you, dearie,” the voice answers without missing a beat.
“But, there’s no—”

Ey stops when eir eyes finally land on the television set. Before em, the screen now only shows a familiar smirking face, staring em back. Eir heart skips a beat.

“Hello, Alex,” Mr Orlok says, smiling brightly, fangs pressing against his lips.

//Where… where am I now?//

“Alex!”

At the sound of the familiar voice, ey turns around, looking for it. But it is much too dark to see anything, and the sound seems to far away from em. Ey shivers.

“Alex, wake up!”

Ey hears the voice getting closer, all around em. The voice — //who is it?// ey really can’t tell — sounds worried. Eir mouth wide open, ey tries to scream, to say something in response. Still, not a single word escape eir lips. Tears fill eir eyes.

“It’s ok, Alex. You’re ok. It’s just a nightmare!”

Some sort of pressure wraps eir body, as if something was trying to hug em too tightly. Ey tries to push on all sides, hoping to escape this claustrophobic feeling.

“Alex, stop it! It’s me, Matt. You’re home. On the couch. You’re safe, ok? Please, wake up.”

A light in the distance appears. With tears rolling down eir cheeks, Alex struggles to reach it.

:: LeaveSet3 [ending] {"position":"100,225","size":"100,100"}
“Alex! Oh, thank the heavens!”

With arms wrapped tightly around eir neck, Alex suffocates a little from eir housemate’s hug. Ey feels eir clothes sticking to eir skin, because of the sweat eir whole body. Ey finds the latter icky, but the hug is so comforting ey doesn’t mind eir clammy limbs.

“What… what happened?” ey struggles to say.
“I don’t know,” Matt answers. “I just found you on the couch, screaming, and your whole body shaking like crazy. You scared the hell out of me, Alex.”
“I…”

Ey instinctively turns towards the TV, still running. Some random programming is on the screen; //Teatime with a Vampire// has ended long ago. //Was all this just a dream? Did I maybe…//

“Breath, Alex. Slowly. Just like this.”
“Matt… I…”
“It’s ok, my friend. It’s fine. You’ll be ok. It’s just a nightmare.”
“Matt…” Tears roll down eir cheeks.
“They can’t hurt you, Alex. You’re not there anymore. You’re here. You’re save. I got you.”

Alex wraps eir arm around eir friend and sobs.

“Shh… shh…” Matt rocks em. “You’ll be ok, Alex. Everything will be ok.”

:: MehEnding [morning] {"position":"725,350","size":"100,100"}
When Alex opens eir eyes again, darks spots have joined the brightness, blending into common shapes: a window frame here, a table there, and a shelf in the corner. Ey takes a deep breath, eir hands instinctively patting around em. The rugged texture of eir couch under eir palms reassures em, and ey exhales with a smile.

Eir surrounding getting clearer confirms ey is back in the living room of eir apartment, the place unchanged. Or it feels like ey are back. The blanket ey used to wrap emself at the start of the evening is still there, covering all the spots it did before ey fell asleep, tucked under both and in between eir legs. Yet, ey is certain ey was on eir feet for quite a while. But, no matter how hard ey tries to remember, Alex finds no memory past watching TV — //some talk-show with a vampire?//

//Weird…//

Gathering eir bearings, Alex admits it is all futile. Ey probably just fell asleep behind the television, like ey had for the past weeks, only waking up now.

//When is now, by the way?//

Alex spots sun rays entering through the ajar window, irradiating the room. With the angle, ey guesses the sun to be high enough for an early afternoon, lunch at the earliest. Alex looks behind eir shoulder, at a closed door. //Didn’t hear them coming back…//

Believing eir housemate to still be sleeping, Alex gets up from the couch and stretches. //Huh?// Eir muscles feel relax and limber, something that had not happened in quite sometimes. Actually, ey realises ey feels quite… rested. Another thing that ey hasn’t experienced in days. For the first time in a long while, sleep — //how did I sleep so soundly?// — brought em ease. Ey smiles.

//Mmmhhh… Neck’s itching…//

<center>~ <<link "THE END">><<popup "End">><</link>> ~</center>


:: Nerve [ending] {"position":"475,100","size":"100,100"}
Alex can’t say whether ey is imagining the whole thing or if the host is //actually// looking at em through eir TV screen, while his set is thousands of miles away. But ey is certain the golden gaze unnerves em. And not in a good way.

With a shiver running down eir spine, Alex picks up the remote and turns off the TV. The newfound silence and darkness does not bring em ease, however. Still uncomfortable from the ordeal, ey springs onto eir feet — a first in quite a while — and runs to the kitchen. This new burst of energy helps em to rummage through the drawers, nooks and crannies of the pantry, where ey finds a few heads of <<link "garlic">><<popup "Info: Garlic">><</link>>. Ey peels a bunch of cloves carelessly, shoving a few into eir mouth, and rubs the rest against eir <<link "neck, wrists and feet">><<dialog>>Prime biting real estate.<</dialog>><</link>>.

Yet, this does bring em enough peace, as they find emself frantically scanning the room, as if afraid the vampire would have found a way through the screen and hid in the shadow of the small apartment. So Alex runs to the bathroom, picks up the <<link "rose-scented">><<dialog>>Another false practice. Somewhat. Some vampires may be allergy to pollen, hence the repulsion to roses.<</dialog>><</link>> air freshener and embalms the whole place with the floral fragrance.

Finally, ey grabs eir covers from the couch and <<linkappend "lock emself in eir room.">> Eir nose overwhelmed with the scent, Alex only finds sleep when eir room-mate comes home many hours later, cursing em for the mess left behind.

:: NoHope [ending] {"position":"725,100","size":"100,100"}
“I wasn’t,” Alex retorts, before adding: “Hoping for more.”
“//Oh?//” the vampire sounds disappointed.
“It’s… all of this is just fantasy to me.” Ey sighs, exhausted. “I’m going through some shitty times right now, and I just needed some distractions. TV was a distraction. You are a distraction. Like alcohol has been a distraction,” ey points at the empty bottle on the small table.
“But I could be more—”
“No, Mr Orlok,” Alex shakes eir head. “This isn’t what I truly want. Or need? I… I don’t know at this point. I’m pretty sure I’m just high or drunk or maybe exhausted. And I’m actually imagining thing. I mean… //Who in their right mind thinks the TV is actually talking to them?//”
“I—”
“And even if that was real, //why would a famous person even talk to me?!// Me?! A good-for-nothing nobody!”

Ey laughs, embarrassed and cynical, before grabbing the remote. 

“It’s late…”
“Wait, Alex! No! No, no, //please//!” 

The vampire, now more than just a head, hits the screen to get eir attention. But eir thumb is already hovering above the //Off// button.

“Don’t—”

The image of the handsome man suddenly disappears, his honeyed voice dissipating, his presence fading into the darkness. Alex falls back on the couch, looking at the grey ceiling.

“You can’t regret what was never there, Alex,” ey reminds emself. 

In the empty apartment, Alex shivers. //Has the place always been this… empty?//

<<orlok>>This set.<</orlok>>\
\
<<crowd>>Crowd laughs<</crowd>>\
\
<<alex>>
Mr Orlok…
''{''//sighs//''}''
I meant a place you visited. Like as a tourist or something.
And bonus points if it’s somewhere us humans can’t go!<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>''{''//grabs chin, thinking//''}''<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>Is it that difficult to answer?<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>Well… I have travelled far and wide after all this time. Was even a nomad for a period.
''{''//mums//''}''<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>Wasn’t there one place, a really special one, that took your breath away? One you know you’ll never ever forget.<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>Mmh… Maybe the— No, not that one. Or that—
''{''//frowns//''}''
Oh. I forgot about //this// happening, never mind. Then…
''{''//taps lips//''}''
I think the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>''{''//eyes widen//''}''
The rift in Island?<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>Huh? No, not that flimsy greene pasture. No, no. I meant the trench itself. The one underwater cutting the ocean floor in half.<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>You… 
''{''//stars in eyes//''}''
…took a submarine and dived all the way to the ocean floor?! How rich are //you//?!<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>Taking a—
''{''//confused look//''}''
Alex, I //walked// there.<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>You… //what//?!?!<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>Yes, walked. It took me about two weeks to get there from the European coast. Most of the way was quite… plain and same-y, but when I got closer to the trench, there were some interesting slopes and cliffs. <</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>''{''//gobsmacked//''}''<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>Granted, climbing wasn’t as difficult as when I walked up the K2. When the walls did not have good enough holds, I’d just push my body and swim the rest of the way. Quite the walkout this trail was.<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>''{''//jaw on the floor//''}''<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>But, the most wonderful part of this journey was when I reached the ridge itself. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a scenery this… 
''{''//moves his hands, looking for words//''}''
I… it… I was speechless.
''{''//turns to Guest, chuckles//''}''
Like you are right now!<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>I can’t— How? The ocean?!<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>It truly was a spectacle. I even was able to witness one of the volcanoes erupt!<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>''{''//speechless//''}''<</alex>>\
\
    <<case 4>>
<<alex>>Are there any... superstitions about vampires that would actually work against you?<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>Well, obviously the stake or whatever instrument meant to kill someone. But that also works for you, doesn’t it?<</orlok>>\
\
<<crowd>>Crowd laughs<</crowd>>\

\
<<orlok>>All right, all right! To my absolute dismay…
''{''//inhales loudly//''}''
//Garlic//.<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>''{''//snort//''}''
What?!<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>It won’t kill me, and you can rub yourself with it all you want, I won’t be repelled. But…
''{''//frowns//''}''
…if I eat a clove, it will, give me a rash. A pretty bad one.<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>So you’re like… allergic?<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>I think //intolerant// is what my physician said.
''{''//sighs//''}''
I miss cooking a whole clove in the oven and spreading it on bread…<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>That’s… sad. Garlic is //amazing//.<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>It truly is.<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>I put it everywhere.<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>I used to too…<</orlok>>\
\
<<alex>>''{''//squints//''}''
What if… what if someone who ate garlic kisses you? Do you go into shock?<</alex>>\
\
<<orlok>>Mmh… I try to avoid getting into this situation, if I can. But as long as enough time has passed between eating and the kiss, and there’s no bits or pieces left, I should  be ok. Maybe my tongue will tingle a bit.<</orlok>>\
\

No, Alex. We don’t have supernatural abilities. We might live a bit longer and have heightened senses, or be a bit stronger than humans, but not to the point of omniscience!

“Me too,” ey almost giggles.
“Y-you were?” Mr Orlok is taken aback. “I… I honestly wasn’t quite expecting this… enthusiasm.”
“Well,” ey tries to shrug nonchalantly. “If I wasn’t… you know… then I wouldn’t have been—”
“Fantasising about having your ways with dear ol’ me?”
“I—” Alex chokes. 

A crystal-like sound exits the television set, echoing through the room with a clearness ey had never heard from the device. His laugh gives em chill all over. And ey wants more. So much more.

“I was hoping you would, dearie.”
“You were? //Oh…// Of course, you were.”
“Yes, it is saving me time from repeating myself.”
“Repeating?”

Mr Orlok gives em a look, the slightly worried //Oh-no-I-think-I-just-created-a-misunderstanding// kind. And with Alex looking back inquisitively, the vampire bites his lip, taking the response as confirmation.

“Did I maybe misread the situation?” 

Alex can’t see his hands on the screen, but ey is sure he is fidgeting with them.

“You never truly answered my question, after all. Maybe it would be best if I did…” Mr Orlok looks away.
“Your question?”
“Yes, my //question//,” he repeats, pressing. “What I asked earlier, when…”

His hand gestures on the screen, as if it was trying to rewind the past.

It is then that Alex realises ey may have been hoping for something from the vampire, something carnal. After all, ey was fantasising quite vividly about him just moments ago! But ey is not quite ready to admit it to the handsome Mr Orlok… or accept it emself.

“… some company,” the vampire carries on, his eyes shining brightly on em. “Maybe…” his confidence slowly wavering. “At first? Or… something more, actually. If that is what you were looking for. I know how many of your kind feel about mine, still. Not like I mind, or care. Actually, I am quite welcoming of the feelings and the attention your lot is showing me. And if I can say so, I am quite the—”

He stops, brusquely. As if the spoken words travelled right back into his ears, his face strangely colours and his features freeze. Seeing the unmoving image, Alex waves eir hand at the screen, hoping to get a reaction. Before ey remembers there is a remote connected to the TV, one ey is actually sitting on. Pressing a bunch of different buttons, nothing changes — even the //Off// button doesn’t erase the picture from the screen.

“Erhm,” he finally clears out his throat and regains his composure. “Should I maybe repeat myself?”

//Huh?//

“After all,” the vampire smiles, “you never truly answered my question, did you now?”

Alex looks at him inquisitively.

“The //question//,” he repeats, pressing. “What I asked earlier, when…”

His hand gestures on the screen, as if it was trying to rewind the past.

“Alex!”

At the sound of the familiar voice, ey turns around, looking for it. But it is much too dark to see anything, and the sound seems to far away from em. Ey shivers.

“Alex, wake up!”

Ey hears the voice getting closer, all around em. The voice — //who is it?// ey really can’t tell — sounds worried. Eir mouth wide open, ey tries to scream, to say something in response. Still, not a single word escape eir lips. Tears fill eir eyes.

“It’s ok, Alex. You’re ok. It’s just a nightmare!”

Some sort of pressure wraps eir body, as if something was trying to hug em too tightly. Ey tries to push on all sides, hoping to escape this claustrophobic feeling.

“Alex, stop it! It’s me, Matt. You’re home. On the couch. You’re safe, ok? Please, wake up.”

A light in the distance appears. With tears rolling down eir cheeks, Alex struggles to reach it.

“What… what happened?” ey struggles to say.
“I don’t know,” Matt answers. “I just found you on the couch, screaming, and your whole body shaking like crazy. You scared the hell out of me, Alex.”
“I…”

Ey instinctively turns towards the TV, still running. Some random programming is on the screen; //Teatime with a Vampire// has ended long ago. //Was all this just a dream? Did I maybe…//

“Breath, Alex. Slowly. Just like this.”
“Matt… I…”
“It’s ok, my friend. It’s fine. You’ll be ok. It’s just a nightmare.”

“They can’t hurt you, Alex. You’re not there anymore. You’re here. You’re save. I got you.”

Alex wraps eir arm around eir friend and sobs.

“Is that what you truly want, Alex?”

The words barely echo in eir ears before ey springs up, eir head almost gyrating as ey looks for the voice from eir head. Ey thinks ey catches a whisper here, or maybe a murmur here.

<<if $choice is 1>>But Alex doesn’t get where Mr Orlok is going with this. The shock of talking to the animated image on the screen affects em so much ey barely remembers the words ey uttered emself just now. Let alone his at the start…<<else>>Alex winces just thinking about that question. Not much the relatively cringe approach of the vampire to get eir attention, but about when he caught em. That moment of weakness, lusting over the night walker.<</if>>

“Is it what you want, Alex?”

A shiver runs down eir spine when ey heard eir name uttered. Ey likes how the syllables rolls on his tongue, how it sizzles in his mouth. Ey wants nothing but hear him repeat eir name over and over.

“I can give all that your hear desires, Alex. All that you want of me.”

And ey wants nothing more than what the vampire asks of em, ey thinks. Ey wishes ey could blindly listen to eir impulses, without having to care of what is and isn’t sensible. Without thinking of the consequences. Of reality.

“I will fill all your cravings, satisfy all your yearnings, erase your longings…”

But Alex doesn’t notice right away the fizzing sound coming from the TV. A buzzing noise in the background getting ever so slowly louder. It itches eir ears a little, at first, before the distortion scrapes the canals.

“If you want it too…”

With a clenched jaw and hands over eir ears, Alex turns towards Mr Orlok. Eir heart skips a beat. //The screen… How—//

“…you simply need to…”

As if it were some stretchy rubber, the screen expands towards em, with Mr Orlok extending his hand to Alex. The hand pushes through the digital layers with difficulty, its shape and colour glitching in the process. The sounds this generates is so loud, so overwhelming, ey feels a warm liquid dripping down eir ears, rolling down eir neck. Yet, Alex’s eyes see nothing but the calming and welcoming face of the vampire.

“… take my hand.”

Since not a single interesting is broadcast on TV, Alex grabs the remote one last time to power off the device. The screen freezes for a moment, with the lingering image glitching and dithering into nothingness. Alex sighs. The TV will need to be changed sooner rather than later, especially if ey keeps on eir new habit of staring at the screen all day long. //Matt’s gonna kill me…//

In the darkness embalming the room, a deafening silence lingers. A shiver runs down eir spine, and eir sigh startles em. Not used to be alone, in a quiet space with eir thoughts, Alex grabs the over and wraps emself, bringing eir knees to eir chin. Eir gaze frantically scans the room, looking for familiar things.

Soon, eir eyes adjust to the ambient luminosity, as ey recognises the table standing in front of em, and the bookshelves in the far-out corner. A faint light outside brightens, shyly entering the living room through the dusty window. The silence dissipates, replaced by the sound of cars speeding down the street, or drunk passers-by shouting at each other just below eir window. And gusts of wind shake the glass a little, from times to times.

Alex falls flat on the couch, tightening eir grasp on the cover, and [[closes eir eyes|Turn off TV2]].

Outside of eir worries, //Teatime with a Vampire// blissfully carries on, with the host moving on to the next segment of the show: ‘Eat or Dish’. In it, the guest is asked questions, which they can either answer truthfully or eat one of the strangest concoctions in front of them. From uncommonly eaten animal organs to borderline harmful bites, the goal is for the guest to ‘dish the goss’, one way or another. The gossip is usually not very hot or interesting, as most guests on the show are not famous enough to make headlines, but clips of this segment will sometimes make the rounds on the web, some even going viral.

To the annoyance of Mr Orlok, today’s guest is not particularly courageous, as he answers every question without a second thought, his eyes avoiding the less-than delectable presented dishes. The gossips is not particularly interesting either — mild at best — with the only consolation found in a potential cheating scandal between the director, who is married and with a child on the way, and another actor, painfully single.

//That guy’s <<link "career">><<popup "Info: Career">><</link>> is screwed//, Alex snorts, as the host’s sharp toothy smirk takes over the screen. His tongue passes sensuously before his teeth. Alex holds eir breath — ey always had <<link "a thing">><<popup "Info: Crush">><</link>> for the midnight walkers…

After the mouth-y transition, the show moves on to its next segment: ‘Is it real or is it TV?’, where guests are shown a picture or a quote and guess whether it is a real thing that happened or made up for entertainment. This segment will usually make fun of the guest for not recognising fact from fiction, or other personalities for things they may have said or done. This is a popular segments among talk-shows, so many of the provided prompts end up <<link "seeming familiar">><<dialog>>Mainly because the different shows share a bank of prompts.<</dialog>><</link>>.

It is a surprise to no one that //this// particular guest makes a fool of himself within the first few prompts. Between the obvious answers and Mr Orlok’s clear <<link "hints">><<dialog>>//By the end, they are borderline answers to the question, and still he picks the wrong ones!//<</dialog>><</link>>, he still manages to pick all the wrong choices every. single. time. Second hand embarrassment got nothing on this segment, it is simply painful to watch.

//What a tool//, Alex cringes, and so does the host on the other side of the screen, with his eyes shifting left to right, hoping to find a compassionate face. Only to awkwardly face the main camera, his gaze piercing the screen… strangely meeting eirs?

Mid-way through a sentence, the host gets up to the applause of a crowd, reminding the audience of the show they are currently watching and that ‘//we will be right back after a short little ad break!//’. Soon follows a montage of snapshots of the handsome vampire, first alone, then with his guest, telling a short story of the two individuals meeting before falling into the clichés of the scary vampire trying to hunt for blood. Ending, obviously, on the //infamous// biting pose, with Mr Orlok’s canine hovering above the actor’s neck… The whole thing is played for laugh, as the practice has been outlawed years ago — that is, outside of <<link "consensual individuals">><<dialog>>Everyone has kinks! Don’t judge!<</dialog>><</link>>.

That last picture imprints on Alex’s mind, those golden piercing eyes breaking through every barrier of eirs, captivating em, corrupting eir every thoughts. To em, it didn’t feel anymore like Mr Orlok was //just// looking at the camera when the picture was taken, but it seemed… alive somehow. Like… 

//… he is looking right at me, isn’t he?//
